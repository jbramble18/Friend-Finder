# Friend Finder Application

## A Dating app in which the user responds to 10 statements, utilizing a scale of 1 to 5 to determine the how much they agree. The responses are sent to a data array, where the program will compare their responses to other "friends" in the database to determine the friend with the most similar responses.

## The app utilizes node.js and express to handle the back end components, and bootstrap to style the front end.

## The app is deployed on Heroku [here]( https://tranquil-sea-62186.herokuapp.com/)
